## Reflections
### Lessons Learned
- Integration of OpenAI API in Streamlit with `st.session_state`.
- Usage of SQLite for database management within a Python application.
- Incorporating interactive web applications with Streamlit for user-friendly interfaces.
- Leveraging external APIs like geocoding, unsplash, and image search for enriched content.
### Challenges Faced
- Initially, implementing the OpenAI API posed difficulties as I didn't realize that the API key had to be stored in st.session_state.
- Optimizing performance, especially when retrieving and processing data from external sources like web scraping for images.
- Designing and refining the UI within Streamlit's component constraints
